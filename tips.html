                <h1>How to Get Better</h1>
                <p>The best training for climbing is climbing itself. But when you’re chasing grades, it’s easy to get
                    tunnel vision. Climbers can obsess over things like finger strength, systematic training plans, and
                    strict diets while overlooking more efficient ways to improve.</p>

        <div class="mx-5 my-5">
            <h4>Aim for consistency</h4>
            <p>The quickest and easiest way to get better is simply to climb everything you can, everywhere you can, in
                every different style. “When you’re able to climb consistently, you’re going to develop skill,
                technique, and specific strength—experience you really can’t get anyway else,” says Pincus. “There’s no
                shortcutting it.”
                <br>
                Set a target goal for days on the rock or at the gym, whether that’s per week, month, or season, with a
                cap at around three or four days per week to allow for adequate rest and recovery. There’s no magic
                number that will allow you to hit a certain grade, but if you climb more frequently than you have in the
                past, you’ll see improvement. “Show up and try hard—that’s the lowest-hanging fruit,” Pincus says. “If
                you’re not ticking those boxes, you’re already missing the easiest path to improvement.”
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mx-5 my-5">
            <h4>Climb Intentionally</h4>
            <p>Newer climbers often head out with a group of more experienced partners and just go with the flow, which
                can impede individual improvement. “Start bringing intentionality into your climbing,” says Pincus.
                “Having a plan and an objective for the day is huge.”
                <br>
                Before you go, read the local guidebook or check out Mountain Project. Choose a specific cliff or an
                area that you want to visit, select a few warm-up options, and get an idea of the routes you want to try
                that day. You can certainly pick climbs because they look cool and are within your comfort zone, but you
                should also choose a couple that challenge you. And optimize your climbing conditions. For example,
                check the aspect of the cliff, and determine if you want to be in the sun or the shade for that time of
                day and year. Good tactical decisions will help you make the best use of the time you have, which is
                especially important if you don’t get to climb outside often.</p>
