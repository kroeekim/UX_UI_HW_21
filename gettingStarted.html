                <p>Indoor climbing is typically divided into three disciplines. Bouldering, top roping, and lead
                    climbing. Each of these vary in technique, but the objectives are all the same: get to the top.</p>

                    <p>Chances are, you’ve been to—or at the very least, have heard about—an indoor climbing gym in your
                        town or city. Gyms attempt to replicate outdoor climbing experiences through the use of
                        artificial walls, handholds, and footholds. At each gym, different "routes" up the wall are set
                        at varying levels of difficulty. Routes are typically color-coded by holds, and their difficulty
                        is marked at the start with a plastic card designating its name and grade. The higher the
                        number, the more difficult the route.</p>

                    <h4>Bouldering</h4>
                    <p>The biggest distinction between bouldering and other types of climbing is that, in bouldering,
                        there is no use of a rope or harness. Instead of relying on ropes for protection, bouldering
                        usually relies on crash pads (thick padded mats) to protect climbers when they fall.
                        Additionally, routes (called “problems” in bouldering) are not typically more than 20 feet tall.
                        Having a partner isn’t strictly necessary, but spotting is an important skill for bouldering.
